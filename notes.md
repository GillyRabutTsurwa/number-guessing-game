## Notes

* Added the logic of the game
  * If you press the check button with no number, it will prompt to actually input a number
  * I implemented the code for guessing, if they correctly guess the number, and if the wrongly guess the number.
  * Enough wrong guesses will lead to game over
  * There's a place in the code where I could have used a simple if statement. But instead I used a switch statement to challenge myself.
  * All looks good. We move.
