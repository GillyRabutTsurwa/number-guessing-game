## Notes

- Here, I am refactoring the code I made from the last commit, which was the feature branch *game-logic-part-1*
- The code is very messy and needs cleaning up and modularising
- okay after some time, the code looks much cleaner
- i am taking this code out of my javascript file and putting it here. it refers to the switch statement in the script.js file
  <!-- 
  - i could use a simple if statement, but I'm a rogue, so I'm using switch instead
  - OK I see. switch is weird. it takes a value, usually variable and checks if that variable is === to the value switch takes in.
  - i'm using switch in a weird way. this post explains nicely how to use it in my intended use case. 
  mdn docs are nice too, mais pas ce que je cherchais: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/forums/showthread.php?32038-Convert-from-If-If-Else-to-Switch-Statement-how-is-it-done
